# Time_series_project

# :hourglass_flowing_sand: Microsoft Stock
This repository contains a series of analysis, transforms and forecasting models frequently used when dealing with time series. The aim of this repository is to showcase how to model time series from the scratch, for this we are using a real use case [Microsoft Stock](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayvvenkitesh/microsoft-stock-time-series-analysis) dataset to avoid perfect use cases far from reality that are often present in this types of tutorials. If you want to rerun the notebooks make sure you install al neccesary dependencies.

The dataset used is the [Microsoft Stock](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayvvenkitesh/microsoft-stock-time-series-analysis) public dataset. This dataset contains Microsoft Stocks from 04/01/2015 to 04/01/2021 daily updated at the same time with open, high, low and close values. With 1 day ahead we have easier data handling and proximity to a real use case scenario.
